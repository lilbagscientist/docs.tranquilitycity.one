# ðŸ’³ Harmony grant

The Harmony team has offered us a grant that goes up to 50 000 USD

In order to qualify for the grant, one of the team members will have to dox to the team.

The funds will be distributed in phases to the team after milestones are met (testnet phase, building a DAO, etc.)

The grant will help with initial funding, covering server costs, paying artists and devs, etc.
