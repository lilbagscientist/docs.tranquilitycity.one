# ðŸ¤¸ About us

Our team is composed of 2 people at the moment and we are planning to expand!

### 0xsparkles - project lead \(@zeroxsparkles on Telegram\)

She is a 23 year old Belgian with a BSc degree in Computer Science. Her passion for crypto started in 2020, during her last of university when the market crash caused by Corona happened. She purchased her first ETH and ONE back then and she has been absorbed by the world of blockchains since then. She is also a passionate NFT enjoyer.

### 0xbeaver - fullstack dev and 3D wizard

He is a 24 year old with a MSc degree in Computer Science. He has been developing from a young age and his biggest passion is video game development. He got into crypto in 2020 right before the Corona crash and has been mostly lurking in Discords and Telegrams to learn from other people.

### Bi-weekly AMAs

We will also hold bi-weekly AMAs with the team on Discord. You will be able to ask your questions in the chat and we will respond to them in voice chat sessions.

We will also be looking for community members to help with moderating the project's social media \(Telegram, Discord\). We will compensate these people in a fair manner.

Our team will not dox itself at the moment. Please respect our privacy. At the right moment, we will dox ourselves.
