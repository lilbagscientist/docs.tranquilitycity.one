# ❓ FAQ

1\) **What is Tranquility City?**&#x20;

Tranquility City is an online game developed on the Harmony blockchain where people will be able to interact with each other, have fun and obviously, trade. There will be multiple districts in the city, each with unique real estate and people will be able to decorate their private quarters with furniture and other items that they can trade on the market. The game will be infused with community suggestions, however the development team have a very strong vision for the utopian world that is being created.

**2) Why are you on the Harmony Blockchain?**&#x20;

We have chosen the Harmony blockchain for three main reasons:

1. The Harmony blockchain is extremely fast (2s finality, soon to be 1s finality) and in our opinion is one of the only chains that truly has a chance to scale infinitely given its sharding technology (and the fact that its already here, and we don’t have to wait 1-2 years).&#x20;
2. The Harmony community is very welcoming, embraces diversity, and is very supportive of new projects that seek to make use of the incredible infrastructure that has been built by the Harmony team.&#x20;
3. The ecosystem is rapidly growing, with new users coming to Harmony on a daily basis. Couple this with the fact that there is no functioning Metaverse on Harmony as yet, then this completes our rationale for choosing Harmony.

**3)** **What are LUMENs?**&#x20;

LUMEN is the in-game currency and governance token of Tranquility City. In line with our democratic ideals, players will be allowed to vote on the development of the city, and the in-game voting system will use LUMEN as the method and means of voting.&#x20;

**4)** **What are the tokenomics of LUMEN?**

**5) How do I buy an apartment? In what currency?**&#x20;

You will be able to buy real estate on Tranquility City in ONE tokens. Subsequent in-game decorations and paraphernalia will be bought in LUMEN.

**6) How does one ‘Play to Earn’ in Tranquillity City?**

Tranquility City will be a play-to-earn metaverse, with a significant amount of LUMEN reserved for these in-game rewards. The way to play-to-earn in Tranquility City in the first phase will be through mini-games. These mini-games will be able to be played between players for in-game rewards.

**7) What is the perspective of gameplay from a user perspective?**

Tranquility City uses isometric video games graphics akin to RPG games.

**8) Where can I buy LUMEN?**

You cannot buy LUMEN yet, as we are waiting to launch the game, and then will conduct an IDO on Artemis. Once the IDO has taken place you will be able to buy LUMEN from a Decentralised Exchange such as DeFi Kingdoms.

**9) Where can I buy apartments and character NFTs?**

You will be able to mint apartments and character NFTs from the website [https://tranquilitycity.one/](https://tranquilitycity.one).

**10) What utility does my apartment/character provide?**

An apartment will be the central place of abode for citizens of Tranquility City, and you will be able to invite people back to your residence. There will be different skill levels linked to the characters (e.g. carpentry), and longer term these will allow certain advantages within the ecosystem of Tranquility City.

**11) What other projects do you have a partnership with?**

Tranquility City has been very fortunate to have won a ‘Launches’ grant of $50,000 from the Harmony Ecosystem, which is essentially a vote of confidence in our team, our vision and our delivery track record. We also have a good relationship with Artemis, where we will be launching our IDO post launch of the game on the mainnet.

**12) What is the long-term business model of Tranquillity City?**

Tranquility City is the first Metaverse on the Harmony blockchain. The idea is to connect people, with new ideas, friends and experiences, all powered by the in-game currency LUMEN on the one hand, and the ability to trade/barter with one another for in-game items such as furniture and other objects, on the other. The long-term business model of Tranquility City is predicated on the uptake of Tranquility City by a growing user base that spend time and resources on their Metaverse experiences. To this end, Tranquility City aims to provide engaging mini-games within Tranquility City, along with a marketplace which will allow trading of items that exist within the city.

**13) Who is behind Tranquillity City?**

There is a stellar dev team behind Tranquility City based in Europe, who have been working hard on the game for months now. A wider team of moderators from the US and Europe are also closely working alongside the devs to manage the community and are dealing with questions. It is a testament to the dev team that Tranquility City will have its whitelisted testing of the game (for stress testing purposes) on the weekend of 6th & 7th November 2021.

**14) How can I get involved in Tranquillity City?**

Great question! You can follow us on social media, and take part in our testing/minting when we launch. If you’re really interested in getting involved as a moderator etc, then please reach out to one of the team on our Discord server.

**15) Do you have a roadmap?**

**16) When can I buy NFTs?**

You will be able to buy the initial housing stock NFTs post mainnet launch, via the [https://tranquilitycity.one/](https://tranquilitycity.one) website.&#x20;

**17) When can I buy LUMEN tokens?**

You will be able to buy LUMEN tokens via our IDO (on Artemis) and then subsequently on DeFi Kingdoms once we are launched on the mainnet.

**18) What is your longer-term vision for Tranquillity City?**

Please see our answer to ‘our long term business model’ question above for an insight into this.

**19) I have heard that you will have mini-games on Tranquillity City, could you tell me a bit more about this please?**

Our development team are busy building the mini-games and we want them to be a surprise. We don’t think you’ll be disappointed when you see them :)

**20) What opportunity do users have to influence any new districts/characters that might be created?**

Initially we will go live with the current sectors and districts that are discussed on our docs page of our website. Users have the ability to suggest new characters/districts and these will be considered by the internal team, and, where possible, will be put to the vote to get validation from citizens of the city :)
