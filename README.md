# âœ¨ Introduction

## The concept

Tranquility City is an online game developed on the Harmony blockchain where people will be able to interact with each other, have fun and obviously, trade.

There will be multiple districts in the city, each with unique real estate and people will be able to decorate their private quarters with furniture and vanity items that they can trade on the market.

The game will be community driven, meaning that players will be allowed to vote on the path they want the city to go and what developments they would like to see. We will implement an in-game voting system that will allow people to have equal voting power \(1 vote per player\).

The economy will also be community driven. We \(the team\) will not interfere with the prices of items on the in-game marketplace. Furniture and other decorations will be bought/traded with the in-game currency \(the governance token of the project\).

There are multiple items composing the Tranquility City:

* **Real estate**

{% page-ref page="ecosystem/real-estate/" %}

* **LUMEN token**

{% page-ref page="ecosystem/lumen-token.md" %}

* **Player NFTs**

{% page-ref page="ecosystem/player-nfts.md" %}

* **The Cassioepa district \(community activities\)**

{% page-ref page="ecosystem/cassiopeia-district.md" %}

## Full transparency moment

We think the crypto world is quite a bit cold, especially because most people are anonymous. A social component where people could interact with each other \(while still under the guise of anonymity\) would probably bring a dash of warmth to our beloved crypto world.

Tranquility City took inspiration from multiple projects such as Habbo, Club Penguin \(a true classic\), Decentraland, Aurory, DeFi Kingdoms and many more. Obviously, we will bring our own original contributions and we will make Tranquility City a unique project.

## Why Harmony and not any other chain?

We have chosen Harmony because we thought it would be the best place to build such a project. There are several big reasons:

1. The Harmony blockchain is extremely fast \(2s finality, soon to be 1s finality\) and in our opinion is one of the only chains that truly has a chance to scale infinitely given its sharding technology.
2. The daVinci gallery is extraordinary, has an amazing community and it will make the real estate sale much easier for us and for the users.
3. The Harmony community is very welcoming and knowledgeable.
