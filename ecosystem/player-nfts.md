# 🎴 Player NFTs

People that want to play Tranquility City will also get the opportunity to mint their own unique NFTs that they will be able to play as!

There will be a total of 10000 NFTs, each unique, with different rarities and with various perks.

The price for minting one of the 10000 NFTs will be decided later \(depending on the market price of ONE\). The price will not be bigger than 100 USD per mint.

All characters in Tranquility City will have skills and perks such as:

* 👔 Bartering - Discounts on market items \(decorations, furniture, etc.\)
* 🎰 Lucky 7 - Extra winnings from the in game casino
* 👩‍🌾 Farmer - A bonus while yield farming with the game token
* **And much more...**

The first 10000 NFTs will enjoy a **healthy boost** in these starting skills and certain minted characters will be better in a certain skill than other minted characters. This will incentivize the trading of characters on the open market. 

It goes without saying that everyone will be able to play in Tranquility City even if they didn't manage to snag one of the 10000 NFTs. We will allow people to mint extra characters at a very discounted price but the downside is, these characters will start with 0 skills so you will have to work your way up the ranks. So it's much better to actually get one of the initial 10000 characters if you want a head start.

The price for minting any NFT after the first 10000 are minted will not be more than 25 USD.
