# ðŸ’¡ LUMEN token

The LUMEN token is the governance token of Tranquility City.

**LAUNCH WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOON**

**Tokenomics:**

* **15 000 000 total supply**

We will be using the Artemis Pad to gather extra funding for the team. 3 000 000 LUMEN will be up for sale (20% total supply) on the  [Artemis Launchpad](https://beta.artemisprotocol.one/lumen). 75% of the total wONEs raised will be paired with LP and the other 25% will be kept for funding (minus the tax we pay to Artemis).

{% hint style="info" %}
The LP created will be locked in a [multisig](https://multisig.harmony.one/) wallet where trusted community members will be asked to multisig the wallet. This is done in order to allow the team to move the LP to another DEX. Burning the LP completely removes the possibility of migrating to another DEX and would back the project into a corner.
_Multisig members will have a role as such in our Discord_
{% endhint %}

**The token will be used for a variety of things:**

* In-game marketplace
* In-game games/activities
* Governance voting
* And much more!

{% hint style="info" %}
You will be able to purchase LUMEN on [DeFi Kingdoms](https://game.defikingdoms.com/#/marketplace) after the ICO
