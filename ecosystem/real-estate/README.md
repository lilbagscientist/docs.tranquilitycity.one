# üèòÔ∏èReal estate

Tranquility City will have instanced private player housing. That means that every player will have his/her own piece of real estate where they can invite people over and decorate to their liking.

The initial real estate sale will have 2500 + 1 NFTs consisting of the following:

* **1350 S appartments - at 400 ONEs each**
* **750 M appartments - at 900 ONEs each**
* **250 L appartments - at 1800 ONEs each**
* **100 Premium appartments - at 3500 ONEs each**
* **50 Houses - at 5000 ONEs each \(house will have their own garden and extra goodies\)**
* **1 Condor Deluxe - starting at 30000 ONE \(see more info below\)**

{% page-ref page="condor-deluxe-penthouse.md" %}

We will allow the purchase of real estate in multiple phases in order to give everyone a fair chance of picking one up from the marketplace.

We will be using daVinci marketplace for distributing the NFTs. This way, it's fair to everyone.

{% hint style="info" %}
An appartment's address would be something like **Andromeda district, Type S, Nr. 1**.

### Decorating

All players that own an NFT of a property will be able to decorate their private housing as they like by using the in-game marketplace.

The NFTs that you are buying on daVinci are just the default offerings. There will be many more items available in the future and you will be able to use to decorate your properties.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We won't offer more than these 2500+1 properties.
