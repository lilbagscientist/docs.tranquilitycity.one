### Decorating

All players that own an NFT of a property will be able to decorate their private housing as they like by using the marketplace and buying/selling items here with LUMEN, our native token.
We're also looking into partnerships, specifically NFT creators, to feature in art-galleries in Tranquility City. These NFT's could then be bought and showcased in your own apartment! 
If you're an artist and would like to partner up, reach out to [_**team**_](https://docs.tranquilitycity.one/information/about-us)_!_

### Farming

TBA
_For now the plan is that real estate NFT owners will be able to buy plant pot's in which they can deposit seed's to start farming. Details will follow._

### Renting

TBA
_The plan is to allow real estate owners to rent out their NFT to other Tranquilians, accruing interest while still maintaining ownership. Details will follow. _
