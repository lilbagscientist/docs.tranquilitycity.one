# üè¢ Cassiopeia district

The Cassiopeia district will be a special district in Tranquility City because that's where we will put most of the activities.

We are planning to add an in-game casino, a community center, a cinema so you can watch clips/movies together with your friends, an in-game voting center and many more activities. These will all be developments of their own on the roadmap.

{% hint style="info" %}
There will be no housing in the Cassiopeia district because that space will be reserved exclusively for the community center.
